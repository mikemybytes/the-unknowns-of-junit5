# The unknowns of JUnit 5 | Resources

**Thank you for attending my presentation!** 

Here's a list of resources that I presented or was referring to during the talk:
- Official [JUnit 5 User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/).
- [Parameterize like a pro with JUnit 5 @CsvSource](https://mikemybytes.com/2021/10/19/parameterize-like-a-pro-with-junit-5-csvsource/) - my article
that became an inspiration for this talk. It explains how to write data table tests with JUnit 5.
- [the-unknowns-of-junit5](https://github.com/mikemybytes/the-unknowns-of-junit5) repository containing presented 
examples of writing data table tests and avoiding test code duplication without inheritance.
- [Pragmatic test parallelization with Junit 5](https://mikemybytes.com/2021/11/24/pragmatic-test-parallelization-with-junit5/) - another
article of mine with a detailed description of my pragmatic proposal for tests parallelization.
- [junit5-parallel-tests](https://github.com/mikemybytes/junit5-parallel-tests) repository containing presented examples
of running tests in parallel with JUnit 5.
