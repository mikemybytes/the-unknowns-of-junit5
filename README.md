# The unknowns of JUnit 5

This repository contains a set of examples related to the less-known JUnit 5 features such as:
- [writing data table tests](https://mikemybytes.com/2021/10/19/parameterize-like-a-pro-with-junit-5-csvsource/) using 
`@CsvSource`,
- avoiding test code duplication without inheritance (with extensions and interfaces),
- customizing test case names.

As it has been intended for a conference talk, each file is like a slide presenting the next iteration of improvements.
